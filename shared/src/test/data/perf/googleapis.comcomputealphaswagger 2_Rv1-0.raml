                Sets a filter expression for filtering listed resources, in the form filter={expression}. Your {expression} must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.

                The field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value must match the entire field.

                For example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-instance, you would use filter=name ne example-instance.

                You can filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. Use filtering on nested fields to take advantage of labels to organize and search for results based on label values.

                To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.

                You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

                Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.

              description: |-
                Sets a filter expression for filtering listed resources, in the form filter={expression}. Your {expression} must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.

                The field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value must match the entire field.

                For example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-instance, you would use filter=name ne example-instance.

                You can filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. Use filtering on nested fields to take advantage of labels to organize and search for results based on label values.

                To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.

                You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

                Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.

            filter:
              description: |-
                Sets a filter expression for filtering listed resources, in the form filter={expression}. Your {expression} must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.

                The field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value must match the entire field.

                For example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-instance, you would use filter=name ne example-instance.

                You can filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. Use filtering on nested fields to take advantage of labels to organize and search for results based on label values.

                To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.

                Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

                You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

                Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.

                Sets a filter expression for filtering listed resources, in the form filter={expression}. Your {expression} must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.

                The field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value must match the entire field.

                For example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-instance, you would use filter=name ne example-instance.

                You can filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. Use filtering on nested fields to take advantage of labels to organize and search for results based on label values.

                To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.

            filter:
              description: |-
                Sets a filter expression for filtering listed resources, in the form filter={expression}. Your {expression} must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.

                The field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value must match the entire field.

                For example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-instance, you would use filter=name ne example-instance.

                You can filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. Use filtering on nested fields to take advantage of labels to organize and search for results based on label values.

                To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.

                You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

                Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.

            filter:
              description: |-
                Sets a filter expression for filtering listed resources, in the form filter={expression}. Your {expression} must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.

                The field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value must match the entire field.

                For example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-instance, you would use filter=name ne example-instance.

                You can filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. Use filtering on nested fields to take advantage of labels to organize and search for results based on label values.

                To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.

            orderBy:
              description: |-
                Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

                You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

                Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.

              description: |-
                Sets a filter expression for filtering listed resources, in the form filter={expression}. Your {expression} must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.

                The field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value must match the entire field.

                For example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-instance, you would use filter=name ne example-instance.

                You can filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. Use filtering on nested fields to take advantage of labels to organize and search for results based on label values.

                To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.

                You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

                Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.

            filter:
              description: |-
                Sets a filter expression for filtering listed resources, in the form filter={expression}. Your {expression} must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.

                The field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value must match the entire field.

                For example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-instance, you would use filter=name ne example-instance.

                You can filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. Use filtering on nested fields to take advantage of labels to organize and search for results based on label values.

                To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.

              description: |-
                Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

                You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

                Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.

                Sets a filter expression for filtering listed resources, in the form filter={expression}. Your {expression} must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.

                The field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value must match the entire field.

                For example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-instance, you would use filter=name ne example-instance.

                You can filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. Use filtering on nested fields to take advantage of labels to organize and search for results based on label values.

                To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.

              description: |-
                Sets a filter expression for filtering listed resources, in the form filter={expression}. Your {expression} must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.

                The field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value must match the entire field.

                For example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-instance, you would use filter=name ne example-instance.

                You can filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. Use filtering on nested fields to take advantage of labels to organize and search for results based on label values.

                To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.

                You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

                Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.

                Sets a filter expression for filtering listed resources, in the form filter={expression}. Your {expression} must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.

                The field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value must match the entire field.

                For example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-instance, you would use filter=name ne example-instance.

                You can filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. Use filtering on nested fields to take advantage of labels to organize and search for results based on label values.

                To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.

                You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

                Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.

                To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.

            orderBy:

                Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

                You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

                Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.

            filter:
              description: |-
                Sets a filter expression for filtering listed resources, in the form filter={expression}. Your {expression} must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.

                The field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value must match the entire field.

                For example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-instance, you would use filter=name ne example-instance.

                You can filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. Use filtering on nested fields to take advantage of labels to organize and search for results based on label values.

                To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.

                Sets a filter expression for filtering listed resources, in the form filter={expression}. Your {expression} must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.

                The field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value must match the entire field.

                For example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-instance, you would use filter=name ne example-instance.

                You can filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. Use filtering on nested fields to take advantage of labels to organize and search for results based on label values.

                To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.

              Sets a filter expression for filtering listed resources, in the form filter={expression}. Your {expression} must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.

              The field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value must match the entire field.

              For example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-instance, you would use filter=name ne example-instance.

              You can filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. Use filtering on nested fields to take advantage of labels to organize and search for results based on label values.

              To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.

              Sets a filter expression for filtering listed resources, in the form filter={expression}. Your {expression} must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.

              The field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value must match the entire field.

              For example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-instance, you would use filter=name ne example-instance.

              You can filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. Use filtering on nested fields to take advantage of labels to organize and search for results based on label values.

              To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.

              Sets a filter expression for filtering listed resources, in the form filter={expression}. Your {expression} must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.

              The field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value must match the entire field.

              For example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-instance, you would use filter=name ne example-instance.

              You can filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. Use filtering on nested fields to take advantage of labels to organize and search for results based on label values.

              To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.

              You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

              Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.

              Sets a filter expression for filtering listed resources, in the form filter={expression}. Your {expression} must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.

              The field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value must match the entire field.

              For example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-instance, you would use filter=name ne example-instance.

              You can filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. Use filtering on nested fields to take advantage of labels to organize and search for results based on label values.

              To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.

              You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

              Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.

              Sets a filter expression for filtering listed resources, in the form filter={expression}. Your {expression} must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.

              The field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value must match the entire field.

              For example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-instance, you would use filter=name ne example-instance.

              You can filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. Use filtering on nested fields to take advantage of labels to organize and search for results based on label values.

              To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.

              Sets a filter expression for filtering listed resources, in the form filter={expression}. Your {expression} must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.

              The field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value must match the entire field.

              For example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-instance, you would use filter=name ne example-instance.

              You can filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. Use filtering on nested fields to take advantage of labels to organize and search for results based on label values.

              To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.

              You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

              Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.

              Sets a filter expression for filtering listed resources, in the form filter={expression}. Your {expression} must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.

              The field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value must match the entire field.

              For example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-instance, you would use filter=name ne example-instance.

              You can filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. Use filtering on nested fields to take advantage of labels to organize and search for results based on label values.

              To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.

              You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

              Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.

              You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

              Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.

              Sets a filter expression for filtering listed resources, in the form filter={expression}. Your {expression} must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.

              The field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value must match the entire field.

              For example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-instance, you would use filter=name ne example-instance.

              You can filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. Use filtering on nested fields to take advantage of labels to organize and search for results based on label values.

              To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.

              Sets a filter expression for filtering listed resources, in the form filter={expression}. Your {expression} must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.

              The field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value must match the entire field.

              For example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-instance, you would use filter=name ne example-instance.

              You can filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. Use filtering on nested fields to take advantage of labels to organize and search for results based on label values.

              To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.

              You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

              Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.

              Sets a filter expression for filtering listed resources, in the form filter={expression}. Your {expression} must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.

              The field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value must match the entire field.

              For example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-instance, you would use filter=name ne example-instance.

              You can filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. Use filtering on nested fields to take advantage of labels to organize and search for results based on label values.

              To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.

              You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

              Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.

              Sets a filter expression for filtering listed resources, in the form filter={expression}. Your {expression} must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.

              The field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value must match the entire field.

              For example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-instance, you would use filter=name ne example-instance.

              You can filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. Use filtering on nested fields to take advantage of labels to organize and search for results based on label values.

              To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.

              You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

              Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.

After an instance is successfully created while this flag is enabled, the instance behaves the same way as all the other instances created with a regular resize request. In particular, if a running instance dies unexpectedly at a later time and needs to be recreated, this mode does not affect the recreation behavior in that scenario.

          This flag is applicable only to the current resize request. It does not influence other resize requests in any way.

          You can see which instances is being creating in which mode by calling the get or listManagedInstances API.

  Policy:
    description: |-
      Defines an Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy. It is used to specify access control policies for Cloud Platform resources.



      A `Policy` consists of a list of `bindings`. A `Binding` binds a list of `members` to a `role`, where the members can be user accounts, Google groups, Google domains, and service accounts. A `role` is a named list of permissions defined by IAM.

      **Example**

      { "bindings": [ { "role": "roles/owner", "members": [ "user:mike@example.com", "group:admins@example.com", "domain:google.com", "serviceAccount:my-other-app@appspot.gserviceaccount.com", ] }, { "role": "roles/viewer", "members": ["user:sean@example.com"] } ] }

      For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM developer's guide](https://cloud.google.com/iam).

      etag:
        description: |-
          `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other. It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the read-modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy` to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the policy.

          If no `etag` is provided in the call to `setIamPolicy`, then the existing policy is overwritten blindly.

  Route:
    description: |-
      Represents a Route resource. A route specifies how certain packets should be handled by the network. Routes are associated with instances by tags and the set of routes for a particular instance is called its routing table.

      For each packet leaving a instance, the system searches that instance's routing table for a single best matching route. Routes match packets by destination IP address, preferring smaller or more specific ranges over larger ones. If there is a tie, the system selects the route with the smallest priority value. If there is still a tie, it uses the layer three and four packet headers to select just one of the remaining matching routes. The packet is then forwarded as specified by the nextHop field of the winning route - either to another instance destination, a instance gateway or a Google Compute Engine-operated gateway.

      Packets that do not match any route in the sending instance's routing table are dropped.

          If set, backupPool must also be set. They together define the fallback behavior of the primary target pool: if the ratio of the healthy instances in the primary pool is at or below this number, traffic arriving at the load-balanced IP will be directed to the backup pool.

          In case where failoverRatio is not set or all the instances in the backup pool are unhealthy, the traffic will be directed back to the primary pool in the "force" mode, where traffic will be spread to the healthy instances with the best effort, or to all instances when no instance is healthy.
